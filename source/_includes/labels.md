Labels are short strings that represent the action that took place on any device, they are meant to give meaning/significance to the messages a telemetry device sends. For example if the Ignition cable on the device was detected ON, the device will associate the label `ignon` to the event that was generated. If the device was going over the speed limit, it will use the label `spd`, and so on. 

For Syrus devices, labels are assigned on the [managed configuration](#managed-legacy-configurations) of a device. The managed configuration has an ev_labels object which relates the code reported by a device (0-99) with a label.

There are two types of labels: core, and site labels.

* `Core labels` cannot be deleted, they are for standard gateway configurations

* `Site labels` are labels that gateway administrators can create, edit and delete.

Core labels can be accessed via [api/core_labels](https://cloud.pegasusgateway.com/api/core_labels). The description of these labels can be updated from the `/labels` api, but core labels cannot be deleted.

Site labels along with core labels can be accessed via [api/labels](https://cloud.pegasusgateway.com/api/labels). 

### Methods
